# TLDR: 
I'm a really great programmer and fun to work with. You should hire me. Take a look at my projects, my blog and my resume.

# A little about me
Once upon a time, I was an apartment manager. Every time I got a new job I had to move. I eventually got tired of moving and decided to spend time with my kids. After driving them enough miles to go to the moon and back, I decided to go back to school. I figured I would just get my A.A to be a good example to them. I didn't just stop at one A.A, I got an A.S and then my B.S in Computer Science as well. I made my first game in my Intro To Computer Programming class and have been enjoying programming ever since. 

While getting my degree at California State University, Fullerton, I got to work with a lot of other students. I was the person everyone went to when they needed to talk over a coding problem or needed help with github. I also joined the Video Game Development Club and the Women in Computer Science and Engineering. Showcasing the game my team made, Espere's Journey, was one of the highlights of my time at CSUF. Outside of school, I work on my coding skills by working with other developers to make things and review our code. 

I'd love to be a part of your team. [Contact me](http://jennithe.dev/contact) so we can get things started.

<!-- # Why Software Development?

<!-- I started playing World of Warcraft in 2008 for a little bit of social entertainment. I always loved gaming, and WoW was the best of both worlds. It gave me the confidence to own up to my mistakes, to speak confidently in front of a group and to disagree with others. I'm also really competitive, and I loved the bragging rights that went with being the best. I'm still friends with many of my guildies, and we've shared so many good times together both in and out of game. I want to work with a team to create games for people to make friends and have good times together.  -->
